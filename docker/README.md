# Docker and Postgres

## Docker basic concepts

**Docker** is a _containerization software_ that allows us to isolate software in a similar way to virtual machines but in a much leaner way.

A **Docker image** is a _snapshot_ of a container that we can define to run our software, or in this case our data pipelines. By exporting our Docker images to Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform we can run our containers there.

Docker provides the following advantages:
* Reproducibility
* Local experimentation
* Integration tests (CI/CD)
* Running pipelines on the cloud (AWS Batch, Kubernetes jobs)
* Spark (analytics engine for large-scale data processing)
* Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google functions)

Docker containers are ***stateless***: any changes done inside a container will **NOT** be saved when the container is killed and started again. This is an advantage because it allows us to restore any container to its initial state in a reproducible manner, but you will have to store data elsewhere if you need to do so; a common way to do so is with _volumes_.
